<h5>Funny story</h5>

 <p>My boyfriend tried to convince me to start playing Dark Souls 3 because it was his favorite game and he thought I would like it because of the dark fantasy genre. However I wasn't a gamer at the time so I was a bit reluctant.
    I do liked the way the game looked so I agreed to try it. I spend hours trying to defeat Iudex Gundyr, the first boss. When suddenly I managed to defeat him and shout out an involuntary victory cry. Which was a bit louder than I anticipated. Which cracked up my boyfriend's roommate.</p>

<h6>The win is worth the pain. But quietly.</h6>
